# Procedure to retrieve author h indices from Web of Science™



## Step 0

We are assuming you know how to get to the Web of Science. At Cornell, you can go to [https://library.cornell.edu](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://library.cornell.edu&sa=D&ust=1540913951732000) and search, or go to

[http://apps.webofknowledge.com.proxy.library.cornell.edu/UA_GeneralSearch_input.do?product=UA&search_mode=GeneralSearch](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://apps.webofknowledge.com.proxy.library.cornell.edu/UA_GeneralSearch_input.do?product%3DUA%26search_mode%3DGeneralSearch&sa=D&ust=1540913951732000) (you should be prompted for authentication if not on-campus)

## Step 1

Perform a Basic Search for <span class="c13">Author name (“Lastname, Firstname”) in the main search bar, making sure to specify that you are searching for author.

## Step 2

Manually check to see if you think there is more than one actual author in the results. If yes, go to [Step 3](#h.rxpqa15xf1bc). If not, go to “finalize”.



##

## Step 3

Refine Research Domains to "Social Sciences". Occasionally, it will also be necessary to subset to Research Areas = “Business Economics”. In order to do so, you will first need to click on "View all options" at the bottom of the page to the left. This will be visible in the final screenshot.

## Step 4

Manually check to see if you think there is more than one actual author in the results. If yes, go to [Step 5](#h.aaqzsmbcio0p). If not, go to [Finalize](#h.vzfeg4dyw5cw).




## Step 5

Manually pick the entries and click "Marked List" on upper right hand corner. This will produce a list of those items marked.  It is also possible to <span class="c7">remove records in the Citation Report.

## Finalize

From the resulting page you can create a <span class="c7 c13">citation report (click on top right corner). Then:

1.  Expand search criteria, so they are visible, by clicking on "...More" next to "You searched for: AUTHOR". Also make sure that the graphs and tabular items on the top part of the page are visible. Then take a screenshot of them (save as “author_lastname.YYYY-MM-DD.report.png”
2.  Restrict to items published after 2001
3. ![](images/image4.png)
3.  Export the list of articles as a “Excel file” (the Text file does not contain the h-index), named  (author_lastname.YYYY-MM-DD.report.xls)
4.  Make sure to select all articles, otherwise the report only contains the articles from the first page (set Records to “1” to the numbero of Total Publications shown at the top of the search results).

5.  From the citation report, enter the “h” <span class="c18">and “i10” numbers in the table.
