Citation data
=============
The "Web of Science" database, maintained by Thomson Reuters, contains extensive and detailed information regarding, among other things, citation details for academic journal articles.

Cornell affiliates can access the database via "https://johnson.library.cornell.edu/databases/web-science".

Follow these steps to download citation data for the replication articles:
1. Visti the Web of Science Search Page
2. Enter the DOI prefix for all articles. Eg. For AEJ: Applied Economics 2010 enter 10.1257/app.2.
3. Limit the Timespan to relevant years to reduce the size of the dataset (which will otherwise spit out columns of zeroes from 1860)
4. CLick Search to bring up a list of articles matching the DOI. Note if you haven't entered the DOI to a sufficiently specific degree (eg 10.1257) you may get more articles that what you planned for.
5. Click the "Create Citation Report" link on the RHS of the screen.
6. This creates a list of each article with statistics regaring the number of citations.
7. At the bottom of the screen select "Save to Text File" and enter the range of records that you require.
8. Save file as ssci.DOI.txt
