Due to our desire and obligation to protect respondent anonymity to the fullest extent
allowable by law, the Geocode files are not available in general public release at the
PSID Website or through the ICPSR. Rather, special contractual arrangements must be
made to ensure that analysts maintain respondent anonymity. Persons interested in such
contractual arrangements should contact Donna Nordquist by U.S. mail at Panel Study of
Income Dynamics, 3200 ISR, Box 1248, Ann Arbor, MI 48106-1248. You can also inquire
via email through PSID Help.
The process is somewhat lengthy and typically takes a couple of months. The timeframe
is dependent on contract language issues and the responsiveness of the requesting
institution. The analyst must submit a CV, a research plan, a sensitive data
protection plan, a human subjects review clearance/waiver, and a completed signed
contract. In addition, there is a non-refundable administrative fee due at the time
the contract is submitted.
