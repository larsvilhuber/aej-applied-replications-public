""We matched students on the basis of student names written on the test sheets and school ID. We were able to match 10,941 students, which is equal to 87 percent of the tests administered at baseline in grade four, and 88 percent of the tests admin- istered at endline in grade six, in the 517 schools that participated in both rounds."" ""We also designed surveys centered around hypothesized mechanisms that could improve learning outcomes. Broadly, these intermediate outcomes relate to stake- holder awareness of school committees, school-based management, parent, com- munity and teacher inputs to education. We interviewed parents, teachers, students, school committee members, and principals. Administrative data and interviewer observations on infrastructure and teacher activities at the start of visit were also recorded. Because we wanted to focus interviews on teachers of students being tested, the teacher sample was restricted to teachers teaching grade four at base- line and grade six at endline. We then randomly selected three students from their classes, and these students’ parents, for interviews.""","N/A","N/A",NA,"Summer2017"

On the website, each child is identified by a code, by an array of attributes, by the adoption finalization costs, and by a set of restrictions imposed by the BMO specifying which categories of PAPs she considers acceptable (such as straight couples, same-sex couples, etc).""","http://www.adoptlink.com/domestic_grid.htm            http://www.adoptlink.com/status.htm","N/A",NA,"Summer2017"
