# Changes

When preparing the replication package, we verified the correctness of the code and the results.

- One small change was introduced by pulling fresh data from CrossRef. For reason which remains opaque to us, our latest pull (by journal ISSN) from CrossRef finds an entry for `10.1257/app.2009.0001`, which however is a duplicate entry:

> Olken, Benjamin A. 2009. "Do Television and Radio Destroy Social Capital? Evidence from Indonesian Villages." American Economic Journal: Applied Economics, 1 (4): 1-33. https://doi.org/10.1257/app.1.4.1

We have filtered this out.
